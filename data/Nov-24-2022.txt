Issues:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bliss.c {
    No longer can run system commands due to current limit of 2 tokens per input.
}
info.c {
    Current version of info command does not offer efficient app management, requiring many lines of code to be edited or made to install an app.
    Current version does not rely on the updated method of application installation introduced in bliss.c app.
}
man.c {
    Current version relies on text output methods, making it messy and inefficient.
    Current version makes it significantly more difficult to update the manual file itself. 
    Current version of man.c is significantly outdated thanks to software updates on other apps.
}
outf.c {
    Current version reads entire text file at once, instead of line-by-line, making it hard to support large file loads.
}
rc.c {
    Current version does not support modern apps.txt file list reading, and thus forces hard-coded compile commands.
}



Plan:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
edit.c {
    Fix file reading algorithm, and keep track of line number to allow loading of a particular line in a text file, as well as replacement of lines.
}
info.c {
    Add support for apps.txt file, rather than hard-coded functions.
}
man.c {
    Update manual to text file chapters in data/man folder. 
    Update manual itself to include all new updates.
}
outf.c {
    Fix file loading issue, allowing one line to be read at once, allowing reading of longer lines and longer files.
}
project {
    Needs new versions of cls, del, list, mdir, and rdir for windows. 
}
