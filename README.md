Basic Library of Integrated Software Solutions, a group of applets I wrote to learn how to code in C.

This app is not intended to be used as anything more than an experimentation platform, or a means to see what I learned. This project is relatively useless
in the real world, and was merely a means for me to learn how to program in C from having no experience or knowledge in it, as well as a way for me to step
away from Python, due to issues I was having with it. 

Have fun! For more information on the project, see the manual. It is still being written, and I will add more as I notice confusing points to users, as well
as eventually re-introduce the interactive manual when I get around to it!
